# James's Summary Page

This humble markdown file offers a synopsis of some of the projects I've worked on. You're probably here to look at work I completed with classmates at UC Berkeley. The links below will take you to various project pages, some of which I promise are prettier than this one.

## SmartCam Project

This was the final capstone project for the MIDS Program. My group decided to work on a video analytics project, even though we had no real prior experience in the subject (it would be a fun challenge). We developed a Raspberry Pi-based camera system that uploaded video clips to AWS whenever it sensed motion above a threshold. Several processes in the cloud performed image and facial recognition, and a website allowed users to review video footage from multiple cameras, monitor feeds in real-time, and browse summary data for the videos.

## Topic Modeling on Enron Dataset

This was the project for a course on building and using scalable cloud architecture. My group used the SoftLayer cloud to build a Spark cluster and perform topic todeling on emails from the publicly available Enron dataset (~1.2M emails). A paper on this project will be published soon in the [iSchool review](http://ischoolreview.com/iSR_Grav/).

## Congressional Record Data

This work arose from a project in an information retrieval course. My group worked with raw data from [GovTrack](https://www.govtrack.us/developers/data), and spun up AWS architecture to parse the data and index it in a Solr server. We then gathered data on occurrances of tax-related discussion to look for relationships with several economic indicators.


## Visualizing Commodity Prices

For this project, my group pulled historical prices for several commodities and created an interactive graphic (mostly in d3) to let users explore and compare prices levels. This project was for a data visualization course.

## My Old Website

I founded a [music website](http://keikaku.net) that has since gone dormant. I still keep the hosting up, as I just can't bring myself to leave it to archive.org. I was a big independent music fan in college, and that interest followed me to Japan when I worked at NTT. This site was a nice little outlet for writing, pursuing an interest, and practicing Japanese. We had a decent following for such a niche interest, and at the time were one of the few (websites, zines, whatever) to interview Japanese artists.
